#Cipher tool
###Objective:
This App allows you to encrypt the data.
 This app take message, shift number and target alphabet as input. And return cipher text.
###EXAMPLE:
1.	“Cat & Dog” shifted according to the Normal Alphabet and Shift Number 2 would be “Ecv & Fqi” (C+2,  a+2,   t+2,   ‘   ‘,   &,   ‘   ‘,   D+2,   o+2,   g+2).
2.	“Cat & Dog” shifted according to the Reverse Alphabet and Shift Number 2 would be “Vxe & Ujr” (C->X+2,a->z+2,t->g+2, ‘',&,‘‘,D->W+2,o->l+2,g->t+2).
3.	“Cat” mapped to the QWERTY alphabet and shifted 3 positions would be“Yrv”.
